Something you should be know before started on this project :

-Dynamic Memory Allocation in C using malloc :
    The “malloc” or “memory allocation” method in C is used to dynamically allocate a single large block of memory with the specified size.
    It returns a pointer of type void which can be cast into a pointer of any form.
    It doesn’t Initialize memory at execution time so that it has initialized each block with the default garbage value initially.

 -File Descriptor : 
 File descriptor is integer that uniquely identifies an open file of the process.

 - Linked List :
    Like arrays, Linked List is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays,
    linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers.
